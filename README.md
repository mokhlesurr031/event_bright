# Event Bright

### Project Story

As a user, I want to use a web application called Event Bright. Using Event Bright, I can create free events and participants can join them. It is necessary for me to have an account to create events, but anyone can participate without creating an account. I would like to view all the events I created along with the number of participants, order them by event date, and search by event name. I would also like to view a specific event and the participants, as well as find participants by participant name. Additionally, I would like the web application to send event participants an automated notification email 30 minutes before each event.

### Entity Structure

1. User
   - User name
   - User email address
2. Event
   - Event name
   - Event date
   - Event location
   - Event description
3. Participant
